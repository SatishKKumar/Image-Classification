Image-classification


we have image dataset of many shelves in a retail store. The model has to predict whether the shelve are empty or not. If anyone of the shelve is 
empty the user will get email alert telling that particular shelve is empty and requires attention.
I have used keras sequential Conv2D model for the image classification and I have used SMPT package in python for the python program sending
an email to the target email Id it can be more than one target(multiple email id's).
Receiver can see the mail from the model in the spam section of the email.
